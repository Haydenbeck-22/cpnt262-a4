###  My app is a travel time calculator that operates in metric units (km/kmh).

#### I used the third party app yargs and its shorthand for process.argv.slice(2) in the first 3 lines of app.js

####  Fun commands: 
- distance of 4370km and speed of 120kph (driving Vancouver to Toronto)
- distance of 8852km and speed of 1049kph (flying Seoul to London)
- distance of 7819km and speed of 904kph (flying Sydney to Tokyo)
